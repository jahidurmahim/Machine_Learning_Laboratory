# 🌱 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Prediction from Agrifood Systems

## 🔎 Overview
This repository contains a project analyzing and predicting **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (CO2eq)** generated from agrifood systems, based on data from the **AR5 dataset**.  
The goal of this project is to:  
- Understand the **distribution of emissions**  
- Detect **outliers**  
- Build **predictive models** to estimate emissions from different agrifood activities  

---

## ✨ Features
- **🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploration**: Handle missing values, detect outliers, and explore the distribution of GHG emissions across various food categories.  
- **📊 Visualization**: Boxplots and charts to detect outliers and visualize emission trends.  
- **🤖 Prediction Models**: Machine learning models to predict CO2-equivalent emissions from agrifood systems.  
- **💻 Colab Integration**: Developed in Google Colab for easy experimentation and reproducibility.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes numeric features such as:  
- CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, N2O emissions  
- Total GHG emissions  
- Emissions per food category (e.g., cereals, meat, dairy)  
- Other agrifood system indicators  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Understand which **activities contribute the most** to GHG emissions  
- Detect **abnormal values** that could affect analysis or predictions  
- Build predictive models to support **sustainable agrifood system planning**  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **Google Colab** for interactive development  
- **GitHub** for version control and repository management
